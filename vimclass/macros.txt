# To start recording, enter to register 'a' use 'qa'
# end recording with 'q'
# to invoke recording 'a' use '@a'
# to run saved macro 'a' four times use '4@a'
# Normalize curson position at start of macro with '0'
# Can append to macro 'a' using capital value such as 'qA' then extra command then 'q' to quit recording
# 'I' to insert at beginning of line
# ':22,33normal @d' to run macro d on lines 22 through 33: enter command mode for line range and then normal mode before run macro
# '.,$' to execute from current line to end of file
# 'D' to delete word, 'P' to place word before cursor, 'd$' to delete rest of line
# '0' to position at start of line, 'j' to move down one line and 'k' to move up one line

NOTE: To record a macro, use the q command followed by a regsiter. To stop, type q.
There are no special macro registers. There is only one a register, for example.
To replay the macro use @ followed by the register.
To repeat the most recently executed marco, use @@.

Position the cursor at the beginning of the line with 0.
Perform your edits and/or commands.
Move the cursor to the next line with j.
Stop the recording with q.

Think big.
Feed and strengthen your mind.
Better to have written a lousy ballet than to have composed no ballet at all.
If you donâ€™t prioritize your life, someone else will. 
Without great solitude no serious work is possible.

Remember, macros just replay what's stored in a register.
